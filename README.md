# Overview
This is an [Alexa skill](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit) for getting suggestions on activities or restaurants in your city.  I originally created this Skill to help get a random suggestion for a date night with my beautiful girlfriend, Bridget.  The [activities.js](https://github.com/irlrobot/alexa_date_night/blob/master/activities.js) file holds all the recommendations, feel free to contribute your favorites with a Pull Request or by opening an Issue!
